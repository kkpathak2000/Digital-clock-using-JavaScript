# Digital Clock using JavaScript  

## Overview  
This project is a **JavaScript-based Digital Clock** that dynamically displays the current time. It demonstrates real-time updates using **advanced DOM manipulation** techniques and highlights the power of the `setInterval()` method and `new Date()` functionality.  

## Features  
- **Real-Time Updates**: Displays the current time, updating every second.  
- **Advanced DOM Manipulation**: Utilized JavaScript methods to dynamically render time.  
- **User-Friendly Design**: Simple and clean interface designed with HTML and CSS.  

## Key Technologies  
- **JavaScript**: Core logic for real-time updates and time formatting.  
- **HTML**: Structuring the clock interface.  
- **CSS**: Styling for an elegant and minimalist look.  

## How It Works  
- The `new Date()` method retrieves the current time.  
- The `setInterval()` method ensures the clock updates every second.  
- DOM manipulation dynamically renders the updated time on the webpage.
